  My name is Kelly Finn and I am a senior computer science major from Wilmington.

Preferably Disney or Dreamworks because I believe Pixar is going through a dark age right now. I’m very experienced in Java but less so in C++ and Python and I have a very little bit of experience with HTML and Android.

Ryan Stanley
-------------

  Hello, my name is Ryan Stanley and I am from both Ashland and Waltham. Back home I am a lifeguard supervisor, swim instructor, and coach at a pool I've been working at for 5 years. I actually signed up for Computer Science by accident, but ended up loving it. Over the summer I interned at Kronos working on testing Android. I also made my own Android app in my spare time (soon to be on the play store!). In the future I'd love to be a self-employed developer, but I wouldn't mind working for a company, maybe even Kronos.
