Few missing things here:
  - You are missing your company logo
  - The project required you to make a docs directory, please see the assignment for details

The application looks good and I look forward to seeing it evolve over the course of the semester. There is a great deal of humor here (obvious pokemon references) and you guys certainly reflect this in the description, slogan, and your own bios.

Your trello board is currently very inactive, please keep in mind its a requirement for the class to utilize the board, I'd like to see more activity.
